# Decision Making With Matrices
# This is a pretty simple assignment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations. 
# The problem is: you and your work friends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a restaurant thatâ€™s best for everyone.  Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so everyone is happier.  
# Despite the simplicity of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data. 
# This process was thoroughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approach can prove helpful on any number of decision making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.  
# You asked your 10 work friends to answer a survey. They gave you back the following dictionary object.  
# people = {'Jane': {'willingness to travel':
#                  'desire for new experience':
#                  'cost':
#                  'indian food':
#                  'mexican food':
#                  'hipster points':
#                  'vegetarian': }
#                }          
# Transform the user data into a matrix(M_people). Keep track of column and row ids.   
#
# Next you collected data from an internet website. You got the following information.
#restaurants  = {'flacos':{'distance' : 
#                        'novelty' :
#                        'cost': 
#                        'average rating': 
#                        'cuisine':
#                        'vegetarians':}}
#
# Transform the restaurant data into a matrix(M_resturants) use the same column index.
#
# The most important idea in this project is the idea of a linear combination.  
# Informally describe what a linear combination is  and how it will relate to our restaurant matrix.
#
# Choose a person and compute(using a linear combination) the top restaurant for them.  What does each entry in the resulting vector represent? 
#
# Next, compute a new matrix (M_usr_x_rest  i.e. an user by restaurant) from all people.  What does the a_ij matrix represent? 
#
# Sum all columns in M_usr_x_rest to get the optimal restaurant for all users.  What do the entries represent?
#
# Now convert each row in the M_usr_x_rest into a ranking for each user and call it M_usr_x_rest_rank.   Do the same as above to generate the optimal restaurant choice.  
#
# Why is there a difference between the two?  What problem arrives?  What does it represent in the real world?
#
# How should you preprocess your data to remove this problem. 
#
# Find  user profiles that are problematic, explain why?
#
# Think of two metrics to compute the disatistifaction with the group.  
#
# Should you split in two groups today? 
#
# Ok. Now you just found out the boss is paying for the meal. How should you adjust? Now what is the best restaurant?
#
# Tomorrow you visit another team. You have the same restaurants and they told you their optimal ordering for restaurants.  Can you find their weight matrix?

# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import rankdata


# define dictionaries for people and restaurants
# for the people listing we'll rank based on a score of 1 - 5. With 5 being the "best"

# due to the ranking differences in their individual preferences which places different restaurants
# at different levels

# Based on the information currently seen it seems the rankings are all similar and thus for this
# instance we would not break the group up into two groups.

# To evaluate group dissatisfaction we could capture thoughts on the ranking results to see if the 
# individuals were satisfied or not with the ranking output. This would be similar to a customer
# satisfaction ranking. Another metric we could use would be a physical tracking mechanism to see who
# actually went and ate at the restaurant. We could infer that those that didn't go were dissatisfied
# with the result and simply refused to go.

# If the boss is paying for the meal, we more than likely would put more weight on a higher cost
# restaurant and possibly one that is further way from the office (to make for a longer lunch).
# We could just rank based on those two items:

print("The the boss is taking us to: ", get_restaurant_name(int(rank_best_boss[0])-1))

# If we go with another team and are given their restaurant preferences we should be able to get
# back to their rankings. We would decompose the ranking matrix back to the restaurant sum matrix and 
# and then use the transpose of the restaurant matrix to get to the user ranking listing.
